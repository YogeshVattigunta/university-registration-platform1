Every academic year, university students face a repetitive and time-consuming registration process involving multiple forms (registration, transportation, provisional admission, anti-ragging affidavit, anti-drug affidavit), fee payments, and physical document submissions. Teachers and administrative staff must then manually verify, file, and record these documents, which is inefficient and error-prone.

Our project proposes a web-based automated registration platform to digitize this entire workflow. Students can log in, complete all forms online, upload required documents, and make payments digitally. The system leverages document validation and OCR-based checks to ensure that affidavits, receipts, and forms meet compliance requirements without manual intervention.

After successful submission, the system generates a unique QR code for each student. On reporting day, teachers simply scan the QR to instantly verify registration and mark the studentâ€™s first attendance, eliminating the need for bulky paperwork.

Key Benefits:

Students: A seamless, paperless, and time-saving registration experience.

Teachers/Admins: Fast verification with no manual filing.

Universities: A centralized, transparent, and efficient system with reduced administrative overhead.

By automating verification and introducing QR-based confirmation, our solution improves efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances the overall registration experience for both students and staff.# university-registration-platform1
